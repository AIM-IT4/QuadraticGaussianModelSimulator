# Quadratic Gaussian Model Simulation

This project contains a simple C++ implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation for the Quadratic Gaussian (QG) model.

## Description

The QG model is a type of term structure model used in financial mathematics to model the evolution of interest rates. This code simulates paths for the short rate and calculates the corresponding bond prices.

## Getting Started
